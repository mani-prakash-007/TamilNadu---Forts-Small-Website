            <p>Krishnagiri Fort is one of the strongest forts in the Krishnagiri district and is now one of the monuments protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. The fort and the surrounding areas, then called "Baramahal", were given to Jagadevarayar by the Vijayanagar for his valour in the wars. Jagadevarayar made Jagadevi his capital.In the 17th century the fort and Baramahal were occupied by Bijapur Sultanate and it was given to Shahji as jagir. Shahji made Bangalore his headquarters and ruled these areas. After the death of Shahji, his younger son Vyankoji (Ekoji) became the ruler. In the 1670s Chatrapati Shivaji captured this fort from his younger brother Vyankoji during his Deccan expedition. </p>

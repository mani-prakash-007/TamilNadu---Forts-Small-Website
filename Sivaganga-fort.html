            <p>Maruthu Pandiyar fort is a palace located near Kalaiyar Temple in Sivagangai District. 431 km from Chennai. 30 kms from Sivagangai which is far away. It is located at a distance. Siruvayal was the ancient name of this town.Towns near the Palace Small Farm are Karaikudi, Sivagangai, Tiruppuvanam and Paramakkudi.Later, a palace of Sivagangai Zamindar was built here, so the palace is known as Siruvayal. A Shiva temple was also built here in the later Pandyan period (13th century AD). The Marudu brothers stayed here for some time and fought. The areas where their soldiers stayed are now preserved as historical monuments. Dating back to the 18th century AD, this palace is a historical landmark of the Marutubandya kings who ruled the Sivaganga region.</p>

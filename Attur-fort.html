The fort is located on the banks of river Vashista, 56 km (35 mi) away from Salem.The fort was built by a Palaiyakkarar chieftain Gatti Mudaliar dynasty under Madurai Nayaks, called Lakshmana Nayakan during the 17th century.It was also occupied by Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and British during various times. While it was Tipu Sultan, it switched hands to the British East India Company who got five forts including this one as a part of the Treaty of Srirangapatnam. The fort was used by the British as a garrison till 1854, after which the fort was not operational. In modern times, the fort is under the control of the Archaeological Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The fort houses two magazine points, two palaces, a court, three treasuries and three temples. Some portions of the fort are dilapidated, while most other portions are encroached on by slum dwellers.</p>
